# MyFirstAspMVCApp
This is my first Asp.net MVC project. I followed the instructions provided by Asp.net and created a movie application, the tutorial: http://www.asp.net/mvc/overview/getting-started/introduction/getting-started.

The project was completed in Visual Studio 2015 Community Edition, with Microsoft Sqlserver Express LocalDB installed.
